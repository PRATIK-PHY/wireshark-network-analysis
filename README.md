 # Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark
This repository contains the deliverables for focused on capturing and analyzing network traffic.

## üìö Objective
The primary goal of this task is to gain hands-on experience with a network protocol analyzer. Specifically, we will:
* Capture live network packets on a local machine.
* Identify and filter basic network protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).
* Analyze the captured data to understand the flow of traffic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
Wireshark: A free and open-source packet analyzer.
## Deliverables:
* A packet capture (.pcapng or .pcap) file.
* A short report detailing the findings.

## üìù Instructions
* Install Wireshark: If you haven't already, download and install Wireshark from the official website.
* Start a Capture: Open Wireshark and select your primary network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet). Start a new capture.
* Generate Traffic: While Wireshark is capturing, perform some common online activities. For example:
* Browse a few websites.
* Ping a remote server (ping google.com).
* Send a short message on a messaging app.
* Stop the Capture: After a minute or two, stop the capture in Wireshark.
* Save the File: Save the captured packets as a .pcap or .pcapng file.
* Analyze and Report: Use the filters in Wireshark (e.g., http, dns, icmp) to find interesting packets. Fill out the report template below with your observations.

## üìÑ Final Report
This is the template for the final report. Please replace the bracketed text with your specific findings.
* Network Traffic Analysis Report
* Capture File: [Name of your .pcap file]
* Protocols Identified:
* * DNS: [Briefly describe what you observed, e.g., "I observed DNS queries being sent to 8.8.8.8 when I visited a new website."]
* * HTTP: [Briefly describe your observations, e.g., "I saw HTTP GET requests for resources on a website I browsed."]
* * TCP: [Briefly describe what you observed, e.g., "I saw TCP echo requests and replies when I used the 'ping' command."]
